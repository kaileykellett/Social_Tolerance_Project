# Hello! 
This is my final project from Grade 12 Computer Science at the SRSS. We were given a few options to choose from of what to work on, 
and I decided to make a "Social Tolerance" simulator, to track how a community's tolerance of those different from them can affect living 
and moving patterns, and emphasize visually why diversity is so important. 

I enjoyed working on this project very much, and while I never perfected it, I'm still proud of the work I accomplished. 
To run the simulator, there are a few buttons at the bottom of the main window that opens upon a successful build, as well as multiple sliders. 
Simply adjust the sliders to determine number of different groups (shown by bright colours), level of tolerance, weight of groups, and more. 
Then run the simulator, or step through to see how each "move" affects patterns. 

One last thing: this project, as with most of my high school projects, was developed using Visual Studio for Windows. Because of this, 
it is best run using the same system, as the project utlizes Winforms for display which are not available for non-Windows systems.
